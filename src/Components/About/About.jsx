        <h2>I'm Zachary. A designer, coder and problem solver.</h2>
        <div className="self-desc">
        <p>
          Hi, I am Zachary Lee, currently a student in Singapore University of
          Technology and Design (SUTD) majoring in computer science and graduating in
          2027. I have a <strong>strong passion in coding</strong> and aspire to pursue a career in 
          <strong> software development or artificial intelligence</strong>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Having little to no background in coding before university, I was purely
          driven by my <strong>desire to learn</strong> and constantly sought opportunities to expand my
          skills, be it through personal or school based projects.      
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A great example of my drive to learn independently is how I built this
          websiteâ€”starting with almost zero knowledge of web development, HTML, CSS, or
          JavaScript. Through <strong>self-study and experimentation</strong>, I quickly gained
          proficiency in these technologies, allowing me to create this fully
          functional, user-friendly site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Moreover, being a student of SUTD has taught me the <strong>art of design thinking</strong> as
          well as how to be <strong>creative in implementing solutions</strong>. Thus, this unique skill
          is what sets me apart and enables me to approach projects from both a
          technical and user-centric perspective.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As such, I can always compensate for lack of experiences with <strong>
            fast and
            independent learning
          </strong> to accomplish various tasks at hand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my spare time I love playing the guitar and trying my hand at various
          sports!
