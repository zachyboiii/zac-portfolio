        long_desc:`Vroom is a mobile application designed to connect learner drivers with certified driving instructors in Singapore. The app streamlines the learning-to-drive process with key features such as:

- Instructor discovery and profile browsing
- Booking and scheduling driving lessons
- In-app chat with simulated instructor responses via GPT-3.5 Turbo LLM
- Lesson reminders and theory test quizzes

This project demonstrates full-stack mobile app development, backend integration, algorithm design, and prompt engineering in an educational context.`,

        long_desc:`Beyond game mechanics,Beta CPU architectural concepts were incorporated into the hardware design. We built a custom datapath that integrates a register file and ALU, which handles control logic such as step tracking, input evaluation, and timer updates. This approach allowed us to manage game state transitions efficiently using a finite state machine (FSM) and structured control signals.
        
        Visual output is handled via bicolored LEDs to represent the bridge and a seven-segment display for the timer. The bridge path is randomly generated on each reset, adding unpredictability and replayability.
        
        This project not only tested our hardware logic skills but also deepened our understanding of low-level CPU design by applying it in an interactive and creative way.`,

"How might we simplify the process for locals in Surabaya to locate and purchase fresh crops by connecting them with the best farms for them through a convenient and user-friendly app?"

In Gunung Anyar, Surabaya, my group and I found that many locals are unaware of the types of produce available in different farms due to their crop rotation. Thus, we designed a webapp concept KebunFresh to address this by providing knowledge on the different farms in their vicinity and what produce they offer. This not only benefits local consumers but also allows producers to increase their customer outreach and reduce their market blindness. Moreover, we implemented a machine learning model to help recommend products to users depending on their user activity.`,

The next feature is that the appallows you to send a single math challenge to multiple users. You create your questions in the page called "Questions". One can select a user and try to attempt the challenge. 

The app will record the elapsed time from when you select a challenge to the time you click the submit button for the answer. This time duration will be recorded and sorted in the Hall of Fame page using merge sort.`,
